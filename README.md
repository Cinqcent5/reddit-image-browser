# Reddit Image Browser
====================
RIB is a client-side image browser for Reddit. The application uses jQuery to fetch and process unauthenticated JSONP. Some rendering is done with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) with the eventual goal of creating richer visualizations and user interactivity. HTML 5 Local Storage is used to maintain state.

## Usage

RIB is meant to be a fast and easy way to browse all image posts on Reddit. Due to browser security protection against cross origin scripting, RIB can only provide unauthenticated browsing.

## Icons

Most of the icons used in RIB came from the [Modern Pictograms](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/modern-pictograms) dingbat font by John Caserta. The rest came from the unicode charset.
